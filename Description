Data Type
Multiple electrode time series EEG recordings of control and alcoholic subjects.
Abstract

This data arises from a large study to examine EEG correlates of genetic predisposition to alcoholism. It contains measurements from 64 electrodes placed on the scalp sampled at 256 Hz (3.9-msec epoch) for 1 second.

Data Characteristics

This data arises from a large study to examine EEG correlates of genetic predisposition to alcoholism. It contains measurements from 64 electrodes placed on subject's scalps which were sampled at 256 Hz (3.9-msec epoch) for 1 second.

There were two groups of subjects: alcoholic and control. Each subject was exposed to either a single stimulus (S1) or to two stimuli (S1 and S2) which were pictures of objects chosen from the 1980 Snodgrass and Vanderwart picture set. When two stimuli were shown, they were presented in either a matched condition where S1 was identical to S2 or in a non-matched condition where S1 differed from S2.

Shown here are example plots of a control and alcoholic subject. The plots indicate voltage, time, and channel and are averaged over 10 trials for the single stimulus condition.

There were 122 subjects and each subject completed 120 trials where different stimuli were shown. The electrode positions were located at standard sites (Standard Electrode Position Nomenclature, American Electroencephalographic Association 1990). Zhang et al. (1995) describes in detail the data collection process.

The first four lines are header information. Line 1 contains the subject identifier and indicates if the subject was an alcholic (a) or control (c) subject by the fourth letter. Line 4 identifies the matching conditions: a single object shown (S1 obj), object 2 shown in a matching condition (S2 match), and object 2 shown in a non matching condition (S2 nomatch).

Line 5 identifies the start of the data from sensor FP1. The four columns of data are: the trial number, sensor position, sample number (0-255), and sensor value (in micro volts).
